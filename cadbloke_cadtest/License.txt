CAD bloke's License terms are simple:  Knock yourself out, whatever, wherever, whenever, however, whyever but if it kills anything it is entirely your fault because you touched it last and you should do backups and source control. If you claim this as your own and extort funds for it then Karma will get you while you are sleeping. If you use it in anger and it works then attribution would be rather nice, if it doesn't work then you never heard of CAD bloke.


ok, you want a "real" license because beancounters ...
